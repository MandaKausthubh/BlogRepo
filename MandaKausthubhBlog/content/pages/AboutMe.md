Hi, I am Kausthubh Manda. I'm an undergraduate student studying computer science@IIIT Bangalore. I work in various fields of AI and ML. My goals in life are to contribute to cutting edge research in these fields. I am currently exploring Multi-Objective-Optimization Theory and it's applications in Machine Learning. I am also exploring other fields in Machine Learing such as Theory of Generalization and Deep Learning. My projects however do include topics in Computer Vision and Foundational Models.

## Experiences

1. **Summer Research Intern - CCSSMP**
    - Worked under Prof. Balakrishnan Ashok on simulating Adiabatic Transitions in Adiabatic Quantum Computing for Discrete Optimization Problems.
    - Built a new approximation algorithm for solving Dynamic TSP by formulating it as a QUBO and using QAOAs.

## Projects

1. **Foundational Models for Gravitational Lensing**
    - Developed and implemented a custom *Masked Auto Encoder based Vision Transformers (MAE ViT)* from scratch, achieving a significant reduction in reconstruction error (MSE Loss) from $0.0145$ to $1.78 \times 10^{-3}$ and achieving an accuracy of $0.983$ on fine-tuned classification tasks + an *SSIM* score of $0.902$ and $35.1$ *PSNR* for super-resolution tasks.
    - Also improved training times by utilizing GPU acceleration through Pytorch features such as mixed precision, retaining comuptational graphs, etc.

2. **Matching Networks for ASR with SSL based mechanisms**
    - Developing a Few-Short Learning - Self-Supervised Learning(FSL-SSL) paradigm and integrating it with Unsupervised Learning for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) under **Prof. Ramasubramanian, IIIT B, Speech Labs**.
    - Contributed to the project by modularizing the code and integrated GPU-based training by using **CuML** and **FAISS** for time-efficient training.
